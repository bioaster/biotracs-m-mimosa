# BioTracs Mimosa application

The `biotracs-m-mimosa` application provides MATLAB libraries for the processing and analysis of mass spectrometry data.
BioTracs-MIMOSA (Mass spectrometry processIng of MetabOlomicS DatA) is a transversal computational application for _metabolomics_ based on BioTracs. It allows building simple to complex pipelines to process and analyze metabolomics data with a high reproducibility and traceability. It is ready-to-use, fast, extendable and designed to handle large metabolomics data. It also allows interfacing available external software and built-in functions for data normalization, statistical analysis and the identification of metabolites.
